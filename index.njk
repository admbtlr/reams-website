  <h1>Open Forever</h1>
  <p>Reams is <a href="https://www.github.com/admbtlr/reams">open source</a>. That doesn’t mean that I expect you to go and start hacking around with the code (although please feel free to do so—I love pull requests!). Instead it’s a pledge to general openness. There shouldn’t be anything obscure about Reams, or about how it works.</p>
  <p>Wherever possible I try to use open standards, and to avoid proprietary technology. I also make an effort to use technologies that I want to support—for example, the newsletter functionality is powered by the wonderful <a href="https://www.fastmail.com">Fastmail</a>, rather than Gmail, which is what most similar tools rely on.</p>
  <p>Note that this doesn’t mean that it’s free as in beer: after one month of use, if you don’t cough up for the very cheap subscription, there are some limitations to the number of articles you can save and the number of highlights you can create. This is to try and ensure that I can afford to continue working on Reams, adding new features, and generally keeping it running.</p>
